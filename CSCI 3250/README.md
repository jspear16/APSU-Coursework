## Information regarding the four projects for CSCI 3250 - Data Structures and Algorithms
  
C++ was used in this class. 

# Assignment 1 - Wrapper Class

This program takes in various user inputs based on 3D polygons. Using the information, the program will provide the Surface Area and Volume of the given object. More detailed information in the README.md found in the Assignment 1 - Wrapper Class directory.

# Assignment 2 - Vector

Using various formulas for different curve stitches to create either a circle, lemniscate, or a rose which is generated based on specifications from user input. More detailed information in the README.md found in the Assignment 2 - Vector directory.

# Assignment 3 - Linked List

Using gnuplot, various shapes are able to be read and plotted into a .png file. The user is asked to input certain specifications to generate a specific shape which is then output into a .png file. More detailed information in the README.md found in the Assignment 3 - Linked List directory.

# Assignment 4 - Infix to Prefix

This program takes in a ppm image, converts it based on user input, and ouputs a new .ppm image which has been altered based on user specifications. More detailed information in the README.md found in the Assignment 4 - Infix to Prefix directory.

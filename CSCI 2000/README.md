# Information regarding the four projects for CSCI 2000 - Introduction to Computer Science with c++

# Project 1 - 3D Polygon
This program takes in various user inputs based on 3D polygons. Using the information, the program will provide the Surface Area and Volume of the given object. More detailed information in the README.md found in the Project 1 - 3D Polygon directory.

# Project 2 - Curve Stitch
Using various formulas for different curve stitches to create either a circle, lemniscate, or a rose which is generated based on specifications from user input. More detailed information in the README.md found in the Project 2 - Curve Stitch directory.

# Project 3 - Image Output
Using gnuplot, various shapes are able to be read and plotted into a .png file. The user is asked to input certain specifications to generate a specific shape which is then output into a .png file. More detailed information in the README.md found in the Project 3 - Image Ouput directory.

# Project 4 - Image Converter
This program takes in a ppm image, converts it based on user input, and ouputs a new .ppm image which has been altered based on user specifications. More detailed information in the README.md found in the Project 4 - Image Converter directory.

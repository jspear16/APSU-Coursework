# Information regarding the four projects for ENGR 4000 - Computational Physics

Fortran 95 was used for this course.

## Project 1 - Wave Equation
This project was focused on the 3 dimensional wave equation for a hydrogen atom, and how to approximate the energy level of the atom using Euler's Method and Verlet's Method. The exact solution to the second order differential equation is known and therefore used to compare the numerical method with. Sample Output for n=4, l=0:

## Project 2 - Celestial Bodies
This project was focused on estimating the locations of various bodies (primarily the planets) in our solar system using Verlet and the Fourth Order Runge-Kutta Methods. The initial position data was acquried from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory website, and the data for the numerical methods was found from the 3 dimensional laws of gravity. Two sample output:
